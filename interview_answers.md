# Interview Answers

Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. Explain what a token is used for.

The issue prop drilling in larger applications which can easily become inefficient in larger apps where state is needed in multiple components across the app . Using Context API in such a case can eliminate prop drilling altogether if so desired, and helps to produce cleaner, more readable, more easily managed code & state/data.

2. What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data secure?

Actions: Actions are the director in the action/reducer - they dictate when and how the reducers need to update state.

Reducers: If actions are the director, reducers are the actors - they take direction through action types and payloads and use that direction to know when, where, and how to update our state.

Store: Continuing this analogy, I suppose you could say the store is like the studio - It's the piece of the loop that links our state, reducers, and actions to our App, while our App connects to it. The store is our singular source of truth for the rest of our application and ties the whole package together.

3. Describe how web servers work.

Thunk allows us to use our action creators to perform asynchronous actions/functions/operations with our action creators. Because the Redux action -> reducer flow is by nature synchronous, this is vital for allowing our actions to do things like make API calls to receive data and update our state accordingly. It can also change our action reducers in the form of allowing us to combine all of our action creators into one single thunk-function package, which can simplify things.

4. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
